Assignment Introduction

You are required to develop an inventory management application for an Art Gallery available for multiple platforms. The system will have a backend database (DB) that will engine two independent front-end platforms: a web-based application (WebDev) and a desktop application with GUI implementation (GUI). You are required to design and implement this application, which includes the database and both of the platforms that will manipulate the data in it.

Web Development
MLO1. Overcome the limitations of static websites with dynamic web solutions.
MLO2. Assess the needs of a website and design a solution that makes use of server-side technologies.
MLO3. Address the data storage needs of a website and implement robust data storage solutions.
MLO5. Implement a multi-tiered website architecture.
MLO6. Identify where user authentication can benefit the user experience and design a robust authentication procedure.

General System Requirements
Two different user account types must be created. Depending on the account type, different options in the system will be available to them i.e. each will have a different dashboard. The two types of users will be:


Admin
There should be one system administrator pre-registered through the backend database with the following credentials:
        Username: CCT
        Password: Dublin

Once logged in, the administrator will be redirected to the administration panel where he/she can view, update, remove and create new art pieces and new artists.
The details for each art piece must include the art piece name, type, and the artist.
The details for each artists must include their name, address, website.
The administrator should also be able to add and delete other administrator accounts that registers their name, username, email address and password.
Once an administrator has been created, that administrator can then update their  details (name, username, email, etc) if required to do so.

Customer
Customers should be able to register themselves with their name, address, email and password.
After successful registration, the customer should be able to update their profile (name, address, etc. )
A customer should be able to log into the system and search for an art piece, this could be filtering by Title, Type, and/or Artist Name.
When viewing the list of art pieces, a customer should be able to ‘like’ certain pieces and/or add these to a favourite list. A customer should be able to view their own list of favourites.
